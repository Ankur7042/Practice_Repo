Q- Find out how to find out the files which are symbolic links in a folder.

Command ->  find /path/to/folder -type l

Explanation:
find: The command used to search for files and directories within a directory hierarchy.
/path/to/folder: Replace this with the actual path to the folder you want to search. For example, if you want to search in the current directory, you can use ..
-type l: This option tells find to search for symbolic links specifically (l).


Q- Find out how to create symbolic links for files

Command ->   ln -s file1.txt ~/Desktop/file1_link
ln: The command to create links.
-s: Specifies that we are creating a symbolic (soft) link.
file1.txt: The target file for which we are creating the link.
~/Desktop/file1_link: The path where the symbolic link will be created (~/Desktop is the desktop directory in your home directory).


Q- Find out how you would use grep only on particular file extensions

Using find and grep:

Find Files by Extension:
Use the find command to locate files with a specific extension (e.g., .txt):

bash
Copy code

Command ->  find /path/to/search -type f -name '*.txt'

/path/to/search: Replace this with the directory path where you want to search.
-type f: Specifies that you're looking for regular files (not directories or other types).
-name '*.txt': Searches for files with .txt extension.

Pipe find Output to grep:
Once you have the list of files, you can use grep to search for a pattern within those files:

bash
Copy code

Command -> find /path/to/search -type f -name '*.txt' -exec grep 'pattern' {} +

'pattern': Replace this with the pattern you want to search for within the files.
{}: Represents the placeholder for each file found by find.
+: Ensures that grep is efficiently executed with multiple files.
